To Be Done

## ‚ú® Getting Started

Please follow these simple steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version: >=18.x)
- PostgreSQL
- NPM
- Docker compose

### Development

#### 1. Setup

- [Fork](https://github.com/UnicisTech/unicis-platform-ce/fork) the repository
- Clone the repository by using this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/unicis-platform-ce.git
```

#### 2. Go to the project folder

```bash
cd unicis-platform-ce
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash

```

#### 4. Set up your .env file

Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### 5. Create a database (Optional)

To make the process of installing dependencies easier, we offer a `docker-compose.yml` with a Postgres container.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 6. Set up database schema

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

#### 7. Start the server

In a development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 8. Start the Prisma Studio

Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database.

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

#### 9. Testing

We are using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to execute E2E tests. Add all tests inside the `/tests` folder.

Update `playwright.config.ts` to change the playwright configuration.

##### Install Playwright dependencies

```bash
npm run playwright:update
```

##### Run E2E tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

_Note: HTML test report is generated inside the `report` folder. Currently supported browsers for test execution `chromium` and `firefox`_
